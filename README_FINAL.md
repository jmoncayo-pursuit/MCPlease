# MCPleasant: The ONE Command AI Coding Assistant

## ðŸŽ¯ The Promise

**ONE command. Working AI in VSCode. Done.**

No setup, no config, no second step, no bullshit.

## The ONE Command

```bash
python mcpleasant.py
```

That's it. Seriously.

## What Happens

1. âœ… Installs Continue.dev extension automatically
2. âœ… Configures everything automatically  
3. âœ… Starts AI servers automatically
4. âœ… Opens VSCode automatically
5. âœ… Ready to code with AI immediately

## Test It Works

After running `python mcpleasant.py`:

1. VSCode opens automatically
2. Create new Python file
3. Type: `def fibonacci(n):`
4. See AI completion appear instantly

## What You Get

- **Code completion**: AI suggests code as you type
- **Code explanation**: Select code, ask "what does this do?"
- **Debugging help**: Paste errors, get fix suggestions
- **100% offline**: Your code never leaves your machine
- **Zero config**: No files to edit, no settings to change

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- VSCode installed
- Internet (for initial setup only)

## How It Works

MCPleasant creates:
- Lightweight MCP server for AI logic
- HTTP API wrapper (OpenAI-compatible)
- Auto-configured Continue.dev extension
- Everything runs locally on port 8000

## Stop MCPleasant

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where you ran `python mcpleasant.py`

## Troubleshooting

**No AI completions?**
- Check terminal shows "MCPleasant READY!"
- Restart VSCode if needed
- Make sure port 8000 isn't blocked

**Extension not installed?**
- Run manually: `code --install-extension Continue.continue`
- Restart VSCode

**Still not working?**
- Check Continue.dev output panel in VSCode
- Verify config at `~/.continue/config.json`

## The Real Test

If you can't get AI completions working in VSCode within 2 minutes of running `python mcpleasant.py`, then we failed.

But if it works, then we actually delivered: **Easy to use out of the box.**

## Comparison

**Before MCPleasant:**
1. Install dependencies
2. Download models  
3. Configure servers
4. Install VSCode extension
5. Edit config files
6. Restart VSCode
7. Start servers manually
8. Hope it works

**With MCPleasant:**
1. `python mcpleasant.py`

**That's the difference.**

**Bottom Line**: One command, two minutes, working AI in VSCode. No exceptions.
